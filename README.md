# FGDC geologic patterns for the web

![Pattern example](docs/leader.png)

The [**FGDC Digital Cartographic Standard for Geologic Map
Symbolization**][fgdc_std], released in 2006, provides guidance and
assets for the preparation of geologic maps. It includes a large array
of reference styles for geologic linework and map symbology.

This repository contains the entire FGDC pattern library extracted to
SVG and PNG, for use on the modern web. This can be paired with collections of
linework and geologic symbols for the construction of slick geologic maps and
stratigraphic columns.

Additionally, this package includes
a [catalog of brushes][brushes] for the iPad drawing app
[*Procreate*][procreate], which supports the sketching
of geologic maps and stratigraphic columns. These can be found on the "Releases" page.

See the [**DOCUMENTATION**][documentation] for an index of symbols, usage and next steps.
